A: The big dance is this weekend. I was thinking… maybe we could go together?

B: On one condition. Where would we eat beforehand?

A: Oh, I don’t know. I hadn’t thought about it.

B: I’m a vegetarian. I can’t eat meat.

A: That’s no problem.

B: Good. And nothing dairy based. I’m lactose intolerant, so I can’t have anything with milk or cheese.

A: I think we can work around that.

B: And nothing wheat based either… my allergies… I’ll blow right up.

A: What can you eat?

B: Not seafood! If there is shellfish within 35 feet of me, I’ll need to go to the emergency room. I could die.

A: (to audience) To think I was afraid he’d say no. Now I’m afraid of potential manslaughter charges.

B: And not Mexican. The last time I had Mexican food I was in the bathroom all night. Fruits and vegetables are okay, but they have to be pureed into a completely liquid form. Even then, no green or orange vegetables and no red or blue or green or yellow fruits.

A: Maybe we’ll just skip dinner and go straight to the dance.

B: Deal. But no slow dancing. And I hope they don’t play any fast hip-hop songs either. Or country music. Yuck. Did I mention I’m not much of a dancer? And I hate music.

A: Maybe we should skip the dance and go to a movie.

B: Yes! But nothing with singing or explosions. And not on the weekend. I don’t leave the house on days that have the letter “u” in them.

A: You know what? Forget I asked.

B: Was it something I said?
