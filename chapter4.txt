3 Friends. Character B is devastated because the person they have a crush on doesn’t feel the same way. A and C try to convince B to come down from the tree. Modify genders as desired.

A. Are you going to come down?

B. Nope.

C. So you’re just going to stay up there forever?

B. Maybe.

A. What if you get cold?

B. I’ve got a coat.

C. What if you get hungry?

B. I have a backpack full of food and I just found a delivery app that includes trees.

A. Really?

B. Yep.

C. Okay. What are you going to use for a bathroom?

B. I will not dignify that question with an answer.

A. Come on! We’re worried about you.

C. You can’t stay in that tree forever.

B. Why not? People do it all the time.

A. No they don’t.

B. Sure they do. Haven’t you ever seen protests where people live in the trees?

A. Yeah. But they eventually come down. They’re just trying to prove a point.

B. So am I.

A. Okay, what’s your point?

B. I’m heartbroken.

C. Listen. I know this is terrible, but you’ve got to face reality and move on.

B. Move on? You want me to move on?

C. Yes.

B. I can’t do it.

A. Yes you can.

B. No. I can’t. This is the worst thing in the entire world that could ever happen.

C. Don’t you think you’re being a little dramatic?

B. Absolutely, positively, not.

A. Okay. Let’s think about this. You liked someone. You told them how you feel. They don’t feel the same way. Move on.

B. Easy for you to say. You’re popular. You have people asking you out all the time.

A. There will be others.

B. I doubt it.

C. What about the person in math class who sits behind you?

B. Gross.

C. What about the barista at the coffee shop who is always smiling at you?

B. They’re like 25.

A. How about my cousin?

B. Are you kidding me?

A. Okay. I give up. Stay in the tree.

B. Thank you.

C. Have a nice life.

B. I will.

(A and C turn attention toward each other)

A. So, what do you want to do now?

C. Let’s go watch the game.

A. Good idea. Everyone’s going to be there.

B. Not me.

A. Did you hear something?

C. Nope.

A. Me neither. I think we have a good chance of winning.

C. Especially since “you know who” will be playing.

(“You know who” is attractive. A and C are hinting that B might think so too.)

B. Who?

A. You’re right. Such an amazing player!

B. Who?

C. And so cute.

B. Who?

C. Do you hear an owl?

A. Nope.

B. Who’s cute?

C. Well, let’s go.

A. Okay.

(A and C exit, leaving B alone in the tree.)

B. Who?....Who?....Who are you talking about?
